# Stochastic Models and Simulation for Real-World Systems

This repository hosts materials for the optional M2 Data Science course on Poisson processes, queueing systems, and renewal theory. The course emphasizes intuition, simulation, and real-world modeling rather than formal proofs.

> **⚠️ Work in Progress**  
> This is an evolving project. Students are invited to contribute with suggestions, improvements, new notebooks, or extensions. Open a pull request or raise an issue to participate.

## Contents
- Lecture slides (PDF and LaTeX)
- Python notebooks (SimPy simulations, estimations)
- Data examples and exercises

## Get Started
Coming soon — notebooks will be published progressively during the course.
