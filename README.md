# Stochastic Models and Simulation for Real-World Systems

This repository hosts materials for the optional M2 Data Science course on Poisson processes, queueing systems, and renewal theory. The course emphasizes intuition, simulation, and real-world modeling rather than formal proofs.

> **⚠️ Work in Progress**  
> This is an evolving project. Students are invited to contribute with suggestions, improvements, new notebooks, or extensions. Open a pull request or raise an issue to participate.

## Contents
- Lecture slides (PDF and LaTeX)
- Python notebooks (SimPy simulations, estimations)
- Data examples and exercises

## Course Format
- 8 sessions, each running for 3 hours
- Mix of theory, discussion, and hands-on coding (mostly in Python/SimPy)
- Progressive release of notebooks so you can prepare before class

## Assessment
- **Continuous Control (CC)**: mid-term checkpoint combining theoretical questions and a short coding task.
- **Exam / Final Project**:
  - Team or individual project built around a stochastic system of your choice.
  - 10-minute presentation during the final session.
  - Concise written report (~5 pages) summarising model, assumptions, experiments, and insights.
- **Final Mark**: $
  \max\left(\text{Exam},\ 0.5\,\text{CC} + 0.5\,\text{Exam}\right)
  $.
  In other words, a strong CC can compensate a weaker final project, but never the opposite.

## Get Started
Coming soon — notebooks will be published progressively during the course.
