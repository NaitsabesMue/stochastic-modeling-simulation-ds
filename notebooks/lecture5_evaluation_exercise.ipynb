    "\n",
    "A small ML-backed support system routes **complex tickets** to a pool of two identical agents.\n",
    "All such tickets in the observation window enter this two-server system and are recorded in the log.\n",

    "- Arrivals are approximately time-homogeneous during the observation window.\n",
    "- Each complex ticket requires a **fixed overhead** (reading context, loading tools) plus an additional random processing time.\n",
    "- The system can have at most two tickets in service simultaneously; extra tickets wait in a single FCFS queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this evaluation, we treat the system as an $M/G/2$ queue: Poisson arrivals with unknown rate $\\lambda$, i.i.d. service times with unknown distribution $G$, and two identical servers.\n"

    "## Your Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "Work in this notebook only; do not regenerate or modify the CSV.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data hygiene and basic checks**\n",
    "   - Verify non-negativity (`wait_time \\ge 0`, `system_time \\ge service_time`).\n",
    "   - Check temporal consistency (`start_service_time \\ge arrival_time`, `completion_time \\ge start_service_time`).\n",
    "   - Inspect `queue_len_at_arrival` to confirm the system behaves like two parallel servers.\n",
    "2. **Arrival process**\n",
    "   - Compute inter-arrival times and explore whether a **homogeneous Poisson process** is reasonable (histograms, ECDF, log-tail).\n",
    "   - Estimate the arrival rate $\\hat\\lambda$ and provide a 95\\% CI using the methods from Lecture 4.\n",
    "3. **Service-time distribution**\n",
    "   - Explore the empirical distribution of `service_time` (histograms, ECDF, log-survival).\n",
    "   - Look for evidence of a **positive lower bound** (fixed overhead) and an approximately **memoryless tail**.\n",
    "   - Propose a simple parametric model (for example, constant offset + exponential) and estimate its parameters; report point estimates and a 95\\% CI for the main rate parameter.\n",
    "4. **Queue performance and utilisation**\n",
    "   - Using your fitted model and the fact that there are two identical servers, estimate utilisation $\\hat\\rho = \\hat\\lambda \\hat m_1 / 2$.\n",
    "   - Compute the empirical mean waiting time $\\overline{W}_q$ from the log and compare it to a model-based prediction obtained either via simulation or an approximation of $M/G/2$.\n",
    "   - Estimate the mean number of jobs waiting in queue $L_q$ from the data (e.g. using `queue_len_at_arrival` (arrivals see a typical queue length in steady state) and/or Little's Law $L_q \\approx \\hat\\lambda\\,\\overline{W}_q$) and comment on consistency.\n",
    "   - Quantify uncertainty for at least one performance metric (e.g., bootstrap CIs over regenerative cycles or over independent simulation replications).\n",
    "5. **Short write-up** (in markdown cells)\n",
    "   - Clearly state your chosen model (arrival process, service family) and justify it with plots/statistics.\n",
    "   - Report parameter estimates and CIs.\n",
    "   - Discuss how well your model explains the observed waiting-time distribution and what its limitations are.\n"
